# Simple Bank Account Application
This is a command line application for keeping track of your accounts and transactions.
You can create as many accounts as you want and store transactions against an account.
The application can list all accounts, show a history of all transactions, and keep track of the current balance.
Data is stored in two CSV files in the application's working directory.
